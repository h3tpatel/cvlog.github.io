1. **Depth Maps**: represent the distance from the camera for each pixel. but, only captures the visible surface (2.5D). Commonly used in sensors; standard image processing software.
2. **Point Clouds**: is a set of unordered points in 3d space. but, lack connectivity between points, making them suitable for operations that requires permutation invariance.
3. **Meshes**: includes general and triangular meshes composed of vertices and faces, with triangular meshes. It's generally emphasized because of their computational efficiency in rendering and ease of editing.
4. **Parametric Surfaces**: is a continuous function over a 2D manifold. Allows, easy sampling of points. But, however global structural reasoning andâ€¯analytical rendering are challenging.
5. **Voxelized 3d**: a grid-based volumetric representation of space, indicating probability at each voxel. However, computationally expensive for scaling.
6. **Implicit Surfaces**: defined by a function whose zero crossing indicates the surface (i.e. simple neural network). Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) are the type of functions used to represent the distance to the surfaces and many more.
